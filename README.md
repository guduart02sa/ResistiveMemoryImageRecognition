# ResistiveMemoryImageRecognition
A lot of literature suggests using resistive memory for implementing the synapses in highly energy efficient hardware neural networks. The goal of the project is to investigate to what extent this can work.


In Part 2 you will find the work related to exercises 1 and 2 from the subject.

In part 3 you will find the work related to exercise 3 from the subject. Be careful when executing this script, it uses full cpu paralellization.

In report_final you will find the finished report, including final results for DNN.
